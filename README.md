# Automaton Pattern

This repository contains implementation of the Automaton pattern in Java and Python, object-oriented state machine, which extends capabilities of the classic
the State design pattern. The intent of these patterns is to allow alteration of objectâ€™s behaviour, when its internal state
changes. Presented variation of the standard solution makes it possible to define state relations at run-time, clearly
separates state-transition logic from functional logic, minimizes necessary coupling and favors greater code reusability.
